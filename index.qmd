I am an undergraduate student at Duke University, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics, Computer Science, and a Minor in Math (3.9 GPA). Prior to attending Duke, I graduated from Deerfield Academy, where I was awarded Cum Laude and AP Honor Scholar. I have worked as a data analyst for Duke Field Hockey and as an undergraduate TA in the Statistics department at Duke. I have also participated in several research projects and conferences. Currently I am working on a project focused on shared security and privacy advice during Iran's ongoing protests. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Java. I also speak conversational Mandarin.
