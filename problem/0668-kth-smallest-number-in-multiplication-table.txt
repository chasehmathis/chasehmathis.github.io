Can you solve this real interview question? Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table - Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table]. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).

Given three integers m, n, and k, return the kth smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

 

Example 1:
