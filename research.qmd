## Honors Thesis (Supported by Deans' Summer Research Fellowship)
Summer of 2024, I worked independently under Prof. Alexander Volfovsky & Prof. Robin Evans
investigating noisy measurements of confounders. 

I presented a poster at the Undergraduate Research symposium, which can be found
[here](docs/PDF_Files/DURF_poster.pdf). 

Further, I created software for the new method, which can be found [here](https://chasehmathis.github.io/ordinalconfounder).

This all led to me defending my honors thesis this fall.
